\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Reading the concerned paper gave theoretical insights for the relevant problem. 
Currently, implementation of the algorithms for Herbrand Equivalence analysis
and using it for performing optimizations, for Clang/LLVM compiler framework
has been finished. 
The next task is to prove the correctness of the algorithm. For this, we are 
trying to modify the algorithm a bit for convinience of proof. So, we are 
concurrently working on the proof and implementation of this new algorithm.
