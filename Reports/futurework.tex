\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

Reading the concerned paper gave theoretical insights
for the relevant problem. After having the initial working 
implementation of the algorithm, the next task is to optimize it for 
better performance and then use it for optimzation of actual programs.
Once this is done we can proceed to benchmark it against standards.
Finally, a proof that the algorithm indeed is able to find all the 
Herbrand equivalent expressions restricted to program constants, 
variables and operators and thus adhers with the theory, 
has to be proposed.
