# Herbrand Equivalence Analysis

Implementation of Herbrand Equivalence analysis algorithm mentioned [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04976 "A fix-point characterization of Herbrand equivalence of expressions in data flow frameworks"). Detailed report can be found [here](https://github.com/himanshu520/HerbrandEquivalence/blob/master/reports/Rep_Mid_8/report.pdf "BTP Report").

Two different implementations has been given

* For LLVM compiler infrastructure
* For a custom toy language

## Repository structure

* **LLVM** - Folder containing implementation of the algorithm for LLVM compiler infrastructure

* **references** - Folder containing relevant papers

* **reports** - Folder containing reports and presentations

* **ToyLanguage** - Folder containing implementation of algorithm for a toy language

* **README.md** - Readme file
